The code here relates to my fourth year project on detecting the first stars in the universe. This done by creating a simulation of the universe using 21cmfast then, adding noise to the signal then, removing
the noise by the chosen method to recover the original signal. However, due to the noise being far greater than the signal this is a difficult task to undergo. By creating a simulation and seeing how well we can remove
the data we can apply the same method to real world data collected by telescopes to see what results are found.
