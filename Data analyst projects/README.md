## Analysing lottery data
I analysed lottery data from the last 10 years to find any trends or patterns. I used MySQL to generate new tables and imported those tables into Power Bi to create visualizations.
The dataset is from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomaszszyrowski/lottery-uk-euromillions-all-data)
