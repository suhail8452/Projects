## Simulating Newton's Law of Gravitation

Integrating Newton's Law of Gravitation when provided the intial condition of the position and velocity, the orbits of the bodies can be found through numerical integration.
For more than two bodies Newton's Law of Gravitation cannot be solved analytically.
