### For my fouth year project, I had to create a simulation using Fast21cm of the universe and then analyse that data from the recovery process with the simulation.

I used different techniques to analyse data, power spectrum, wavelet transform, correlation and cylindrical power spectrum.
I didn't have enough time to use 3D k-space spectrums.
