## Fourth year project - Detecting the first stars

For my fouth year project I created a simulation of the universe using Fast21cm. After applying noise to the data and then removing the noise to retrieve the data.
I used different techniques to analyse the retrieved signal to the simulation. The techniques used are Power Spectrum, Wavelet Transform, Cylindrical Power Spectrum and Pearson Correlation.

I worked with a project partner (Vlad Zenko) on this project but we focused on diiferent aspects of the project.
